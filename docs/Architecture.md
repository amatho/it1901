# Project architecture
The project structure is split in three layers: **domain**, **user interface** and **persistence**.
Each layer is well documented and has been tested thoroughly. <br/>
We have decided to split the files into two modules. One module consists of domain
and persistence (core). The other consists of the user interface (gui). <br/>

**CORE** <br/>
[golfapp-core](gr2009/golfapp-core)

**GUI** <br/>
